# fall-object
*Java*

It is a program to calculate the distance travelled by the object when it is dropped from a height y with a certain amount of speed x.
This program calculates both the theoritical distance travelled by the object which is derived from the formulae and the estimated distance travelled by the object when it takes into account the speed of the object at every instant.
